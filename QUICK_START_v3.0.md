3. Select: `jtp gen_GenMusic_Melody Generator Dialog.lua`

### Step 2: Select Pianist/Guitarist Mode

3. Set **Number of Voices** to 3-5 (for pianist/guitarist feel)
4. When asked for **Polyphony Mode**, choose: **"Pianist/Guitarist (Chords + Fills)"**

### Step 3: Enjoy Master-Level Improvisation!
The script will now generate sophisticated improvisations with:

- **Fills** between chords using 39 different techniques
- **Motif development** where musical ideas return transformed
- **Sophisticated ornaments** like trills, turns, grace notes
- **Polyrhythms** including triplets and quintuplets
- **Register exploration** with dramatic leaps and cascades
- **Harmonic sophistication** with extensions and alterations

## What to Listen For 👂

### Ornamentation
- Quick **trills** on sustained notes
- Elegant **turns** at phrase endings
- **Grace note clusters** leading into chords
- **Chromatic approaches** (jazz-style outside notes)

### Rhythmic Interest
- **Triplet runs** flowing between chords
- **Quintuplet flourishes** for complexity
- **Syncopated riffs** with off-beat emphasis
- **Rubato passages** that speed up and slow down naturally

### Dramatic Moments
- **Wide interval jumps** (octave leaps)
- **Cascade descents** rushing downward
- **Ascending rockets** shooting up to high register
- **Octave-displaced arpeggios**

### Musical Intelligence
- **Motifs that return** - you'll hear musical ideas come back transformed:
  - Higher or lower (sequence)
  - Backwards (retrograde)
  - Upside down (inversion)
  - Fragmented into pieces
  - With different rhythm

### Harmonic Color
- **Extended chords** (9ths, 11ths, 13ths)
- **Altered tones** (chromatic substitutions)
- **Tension and resolution** arcs
- **Modal flavors** (characteristic scale colors)
